## CEO

He is the CEO of the company, and is extremely busy. He does not look at code, and usually sees new features a day or more after they've landed. He relies on a select few in his company to relay the important news, and keep the different departments in the company moving forward.

### Products & Services

#### Gmail

He spends a lot of time reading emails, prioritizing replies, and cultivating responses.

#### Asana

His team uses Asana to track tasks, and he has an account. But only looks at it once a month, at best.

#### Spotify

He has it, but never has the luxury of listing to anything while working.

### Conjure

#### Problem

Normally he does not see the result of new features until they are already live.

#### Solution

He should have the ability to view what is in progress, and be able to view all active features.

#### Use Case

- Review UX & design of active development branches
- Give feedback to design and engineering leads
- Give feedback to product managment
- Stop a task from being worked on
- Push a task's priority higher
- Pass a link, of an active branch, to others in the team
- Pass a link, of an active branch, to a contact at another company
- Pass a link to friends and family to get feedback
