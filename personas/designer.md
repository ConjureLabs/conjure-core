## Designer

He is a designer working at a series seed or A company. His day-to-day involves syncing with product managers to determine requirements of new features, building wireframes for these new features, working on high-fidelity designs if needed, and maninting an active product style guide.

When a feature is designed, it is passed on to one or more engineers. At this point he usually needs to give an explanation of the design, and will sync up with the engineers during the development process to make sure things look right, and to alter anything if the experience is not as desired.

### Products & Services

#### Sketch

He mainly uses Sketch to work on designs. He uses it for wireframes and high-fidelity.

#### Asana

His team uses Asana to track tasks, set due dates, and monitor the project activity.

#### Spotify

Most of his design work is done while wearing headphones and listening to his favorite playlists on Spotify.

#### Dribbble

He lurks on Dribbble, and likes to use it to watch design trends. Some of his favorite designers use it actively, but he thinks most of it is an echo-chamber.

#### Behance

He rarely posts on Behance, but uses it to get inspiration and see his favorite designers' work.

### Conjure

#### Problem

Very often he does not get to see the progress of his work, while it is being developed into the product. When he does, it involves him going over to an engineer, looking at their screen, and having them pull up the work.

#### Solution

Instead of having to bother the engineer is person, he can have the engineer pass him a link to the work. That way, he can give quick feedback, and let the engineer focus. It also allows him to go through all active branches of work in one swoop, giving feedback to various engineers, which means he can block off time each day to do this.

#### Use Case

- Review design of active development branches
- Give feedback to developers
- Pass the link to design/product managers
- Pass the link to other designers on his team
