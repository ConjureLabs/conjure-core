## Engineering Manager

He is a former software engineer, who has since transitioned to managing a team of 5 to 10 engineers. His day consists of a morning stand-up with the team, reviewing active tasks, prioritizing the immediate tasks on the roadmap, and checking in with individual team members on a regular basis to ensure that development is progressing as expected.

He is responsible for his team's progress, and needs to elevate any concern to his own managers. Twice a week he meets with his direct managers to review active work, give a general update, and make sure his own understanding of the immediate roadmap is correct.

He feels personally responsible for his team's performance, and also actively shields his team from the minute-by-minute stresses of upper management. These stresses usually come from managers changing priorities, being unaware of where things are in the development flow, and being frustrated with development time vs quality.

### Products & Services

#### GitHub

He is a member of the team's GitHub projects, but only uses high-level to see what pull requests are open, and tracking developer commit percentages.

#### Asana

His team uses Asana to track tasks, set due dates, and monitor the project activity. He spends a lot of time rearranging tasks due to priority changes, filling in tasks with descriptions, assigning tasks to designers and engineers, and using the tools to track individual-level performance.

#### Spotify

He likes to isolate himself, to focus on his work, while listening to a few of his favorite albums, using Apple headphones, but usually has too many distractions and adhoc conversations to be able to do this. He may get a couple hours of music in a week.

### Conjure

#### Problem

He holds standups in the morning to touch base and see if anything is ahead or behind schedule. For larger projects he will often go to the corresponding engineers' desks, looking over their shoulder, and ask about the state of the work. This usually means that the engineer gives a very short answer, not wanting to discuss it much, and showing him a browser window (if available at that moment) of the current progress. He uses this opportunity to give any feedback, trying to make sure the feature will be well receieved by the rest of the team.

#### Solution

He could save his engineers the time and context shift by not going to their desks so frequently. Usually he does this to see the work. Using Conjure he could instead view a list of what is actively being worked on, and open any branch to view it.

#### Actions

When using Conjure, he may:

- Give feedback to his engineers
- Pull in a more senior engineer to check something in the branch
- Show the branch to his managers, in person
- Pass a link, for the branch, to his managers
- Pass a link, for the branch, to the designer who worked on the feature
- Pass a link, for the branch, to company stakeholders who may want to give feedback
