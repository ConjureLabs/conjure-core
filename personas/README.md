## Personas

These are documented personas for the application audience.

Names, gender, income or any other attribute not related to the app usage, and that may incite personal bias, is to be avoided. All personas will use the pronoun 'he' to be consistent; This is not to imply male gender, but meant to create a baseline of bias across all personas, and is due to the lack of an appropriate pronoun for both genders ('they' is not great, since it makes personas less approachable).
