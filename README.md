## RabbitMQ

On MacOS? [Install it via homebrew](https://www.rabbitmq.com/install-homebrew.html).

Then, run it locally via `PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/sbin rabbitmq-server`.

Once running, you can close that tab if wanted, and it should run in the background.

If you try starting it again, and get an error of `ERROR: node with name "rabbit" already running on "localhost"`, then you're already set.
